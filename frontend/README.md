<p align="center">To create App frontend use <strong>React</strong> + <strong>Vite</strong>, <strong>Redux-Toolkit</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> libraries.</p>

In <strong>Dashboard</strong> App you can create desks, lists and tasks witch you need, rename or delete all of them, also you can move task into another list or edit task. Dashboard app have logs (history), common - for entire app and task history, which you can see when open task.

Donâ€™t blame the styles, the application will be updated, but for now the main working version has been created.
